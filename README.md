659 Software

This is my repository of web code that I use as a framework for creating web applications in PHP and JavaScript.

Although I know that various PHP frameworks exist for web furniture I created my own for two main reasons: (1) to become familiar with the OO constructs of the PHP language, and (2) as a framework for me to immediately use in the re-development of my scoregeous.com website.

My intention is to create fully abstracted web furniture for simple development of my web apps and to use UI frameworks such as ReactJS for rendering complex components aligned to very specific functionality.
